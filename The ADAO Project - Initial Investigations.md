***Synopsis: Minor Project Concerns, Getting Up To Speed On The ADAO Project, Questions Relating To: Community Engagement, Brand Awareness, Content Creation, Educational Information, ADAO Branding and the ADAO Website.***

#### 1. Introduction

Within this document, we present a number of potential issues and concerns associated with the ADAO project. Shortly thereafter a number of domain-specific project questions are raised. In addition, a set of potential contributions which could be made are outlined. Finally, a request for feedback is made.

#### 2. Minor Project Concerns

There is another Cardano project with the name: ADADAO, it's listed as a legitimate stable-coin project on CardanoCube: [https://www.cardanocube.io/projects/adadao](https://www.cardanocube.io/projects/adadao).

The information on their website talks about tokens such as AUSD and ADAO (this could be confusing for people as they recognise both this project and ADADAO).

#### 2.1. Considerations: Minor Project Concerns

* Is this something we should be taking into consideration? 
* Is it a concern at all? 
* Is it a non-issue?

#### 3. Getting Up To Speed: The ADAO Project

Right, so I've only really been reading through all the ADAO channels, tweets, the website, etc for the last day or two. However, I really do like the project concept & I would be very happy to get more involved.

#### 3.1. Project Related Questions

After having briefly reviewed the above, I have some questions (which may or may not have answers - I may have simply not come across them, if this is the case, my apologies. I am doing my best to get up to speed as fast as possible).

#### 3.1.1. Community Engagement

* What strategies are we currently utilising to generate community engagement with ADAO?
* Have we exhaustively considered as many strategies as possible?
* Do we have individuals who are solely responsible for developing community engagement?

#### 3.1.2. Brand Awareness

* Similarly, what are our strategies surrounding raising brand awareness?
* Does anybody feel that alternative strategies may be more fruitful in terms of accomplishing a higher degree of brand awareness?
* Do we have the resources necessary to implement increasingly successful strategies to raise brand awareness (such as marketing professionals)?

#### 3.1.3. Content Creation

* What kind of content do we currently produce, other than posts on Twitter and posts within this discord channel?
* Do we record meetings and post them online for transparency, or do we simply take minutes?
* What do our ADAO members think about potentially recording meetings?
* Do we have an available blog?
* Do we have dedicated content creators?
* What kind of content do ADAO members think would be most appropriate to produce in order to achieve better community engagement and a larger degree of brand awareness?

#### 3.1.4. Educational Information

* Is educational information related to DAOs something we may consider providing to a general audience and the community at large?

#### 3.1.5. ADAO Branding

* Do we have any plans to produce new graphics related to ADAOs branding? e.g. Project Infographics & related industry Infographics?
* Do we have a branding bible for the project?

#### 3.1.6. The ADAO Website

* What is the general consensus on ADAOs current website and its form? Is a very simple one page website appropriate for a project of this magnitude?
* What do ADAO members think of the current ADAO website?
* Is the website hosted on IPFS (as it is a single page, but I noticed there were JS scripts which made it look like some kind of WordPress install, which I thought was strange, there is also quite a bit of unnecessary CSS and JS that is loaded on each page request).
* If ADAO had a web developer work on building out a much more informative website, would this be something that worth spending some time on?

#### 4. Potential Short Term Contributions

Within this section I will outline some areas of work that I believe I can be instrumental or at least helpful in developing for ADAO.

#### 4.1. An Initial 'Naive' Marketing Strategy

Having ran a small business in the past, I am familiar with a variety of marketing tools. I would suggest the following:

* Building a set of newsletter audiences and serving newsletters via MailChimp (I'm happy to finance this if other ADAO members are committed to helping out in terms of content creation and newsletter creation).
* Using as any avenues of social media as possible, but primarily targeting building a larger following on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. I am friends with an extremely successful marketing expert for whom I can have a chat with and create some strategy documents for accomplishing agreed upon goals.
* I would be happy to implement some strategies so long as help from other ADAO members was provided in order to maintain these strategies over time.

#### 4.2. Methodologies, Interfaces & Incentive Structures For Content Creation & Educational Resources

Personally, I believe educational resources are key for adoption of these novel technologies which individuals outside of our industry / domain really don't understand. Thus, I would be happy to either install an already existing blogging platform (such as WordPress) or even build out BASIC bespoke system (which I have done before in a previous job - it was a CRUD system which created 'articles' to help graduates find jobs and to give them advice on doing so).

Further, I have some ideas regarding the creation of incentive structures for generating high quality content, for which I would be happy to create a strategy document.

#### 4.3. Refining ADAO Branding

I would consider myself to be a OKAY-ish graphics designer, you can see some of the work one of my previous businesses did for our clients here: [https://theydo.digital/](https://theydo.digital/) - I was the director of TheyDoDigital, but as we were based in North Wales, I quickly found that smaller businesses based in the countryside are not too happy to pay city prices for high quality work. They're much happier paying less for people who are pretty shit at their jobs.

In short: I would be happy to help in providing assistance in anything related to graphics design for ADAO.

#### 4.4. Building out ADAO Branding Guidelines

A branding bible is something that every organisation should have for contributing members. Again, I can build one of these out should you wish.

#### 4.5. An Augmented Or Alternative ADAO Website

To be blunt, the ADAO website ([http://www.theadadao.com/](http://www.theadadao.com/)) is rather lack lustre.

Web development and a certain degree of web design is a genuine passion of mine; and I would be happy undertaking a project to build a website/webapp that can augment the existing website, or completely replace it. I am happy to work with any other ADAO Members on this, as it may be a fairly sizable project. But I would be more than happy to undertake such a project.

#### 5. Request For Feedback & Thoughts from ADAO Members

Any answers, feedback, critique, etc. of the questions and content of this document is more than welcomed (and, of course, encouraged).

Please let me know what you guys think; and what, if anything you would like me to prioritise; or if there are other more pressing issues which need to be prioritised, do let me now.

Cheers.
