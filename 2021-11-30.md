# Meeting with @DripDropz 32021-11-30  

* DripDropz want's to make ISPOs fairer and more accessible
\
  * Current ISPOs are limited to specific pools and their delegators
		
* DripDropz hosts a platform from where you can mass send tokens
  * You can create individual profiles per project
* Airdrop Tokens to potentially all ADA holders
  * No limitation 
* Rewards have to be collected every Epoch
  * Otherwise lost
* DripDropz only transports Tokens, they don't sell them

* Support SPOs:
  * Potentially include a certain list of SPOs
  * We have to configure our parameters to only include single pools

* We would distribute GovToken solely for voting
  * Bounties that we set can be voted on with GovTokens
   * Completion of Bounties is rewarded with ADA

* Business Model:
  * Find pools that provide mutual benefits
  * DripDropz would help with distribution of GovTokens
  * Legal issues with Token Distribution


* First generated address of stake key is used
  * When you query your wallet you can check what tokens are available for withdrawl
  * In theory are different users able to pay for other users token release 
  * First address of stake key is queried

* DripDropz Contact on Discord @Anthony McD#0810

## Notes of separate Meeting



**ADAOs Mission is to become  Decentralized Project Funding**
		
### Ideas:

* Get input from Ryan @Ardana or @Liqwid to improve our treasury
* ADAO reserve curreny
* Smart contract staking possible?
  * dApps can stake their funds

* Sponsor small pools:
* How can we choose pools?
  * Set-up parameters upon which pools are chosen that we can use
   * Mutual benefit in mind
   * How much % do we get from rewards?
    * Do we get it instantly?
    * Does it depend on total amount of stake we generate?
   * Good causes
   * Adding value to the network
    * Charity
    * Create open-source code
    * etc.
    
* What parameters can we measure to ensure a pool is operated well?
  * Missed blocks - If a pool is not running correctly you can see it like that
