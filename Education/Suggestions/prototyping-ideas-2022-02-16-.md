### Suggestions for Educational Working Group (prototyping ideas):

* **Suggestion For Educational Materials (Internal Tooling):**

	* Title: Curate & Create internal tooling resources (for Git & GitHub) for working group leads who do not have a technical background or who have not used Git & GitHub within teams before.
	* Reason: This allows them to contribute to the central repo, provides a more organised global view of the progress made by each working group.
	* Extra Information: 
		
		1. These resources wouldn't necessarily be for developers, they would be aimed at less technical or non-technical working groups.
		2. Materials would be in written and video (tutorial) form.
		3. Materials would demonstrate how to **navigate GitHub**.
		4. Materials would demonstrate how to use **Git CLI - VERY BASIC**.
		4. Materials would demonstrate how to **contribute to GitHub using GitHub**.
		5. Materials would demonstrate how to **contribute to GitHub using Git CLI**.
		6. Materials would provide an **insight into Pull Requests & how to collaborate using PRs**.
		7. Materials would **encourage comments**.
		8. Materials would **encourage reviews**.
		9. Materials would **encourage feedback**.
		10. Materials would not be aimed at technical individuals.
		11. Materials would establish **very basic standards** (e.g. please don't push to master without opening a PR).

* **Suggestion For Educational Materials (Curating Internal & External - DAOs):**

	* Title: Creating an index for our current library & adding some additional materials to it.
	* Reason: Make it easier to navigate our materials for:
		
		1. Newcomers to Crypto.
		2. Intermediate without much knowledge of DAOs.
		3. Intermediate with some knowledge of DAOs.
		4. Builders / Developers who want to read up on current implementations that have already been deployed.
		5. Researchers (Typically papers).
