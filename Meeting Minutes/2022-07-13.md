ADAO July 13

A short Wednesday meeting

TCT and others mention all the good work being done. ADAO has been accomplishing a lot and producing great work. 

RATS DAO conversation: 
- There is still planning and further understanding needed to be done between the two parties. 
- Seems a good idea that Rats submit bounty proposals for requested work moving forward
- Explore other means of value transfer between the two parties other than Rats tokens

Emurgo Catalyst Event : 
- ADAO will be presenting their proposals for the Emurgo event. 
- Date of presentation is still not decided, but it will be either Monday or Tuesday of the coming week (July 18/19)

* Important to keep receiving feedback on anything ADAO produces so improvements can be made
