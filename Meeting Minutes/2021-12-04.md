## Treasury News:

* We already have a treasury with a stakeaddress
  * Possibility to start staking our treasury


### IDEAS:
* Create a repository template for catalyst proposals 
  * Working with GitHub enables members to perfectly track what progress has been made
  * Version control is implemented from the get go
			
## Budget / Timeline of our current proposal:
	
### **1 month:**
* Something that is wokring with property based testing 
* Enabling Governance via script for potentially all GovToken holders
* Cardano-cli will be necessary
* **Proposal based system:**
  * On-chain code is complete
  * Testing happens now
	  * How does the proposal system work?
		  * Proposal can be submitted by everyone
			  * **Proposal is an empty eUTXO**
				* It can do three things:
				  1. Spend from treasury to specific address with specific amount
				      * Identity NFT is present at transaction in script
				  2. Mint new Governance Tokens
				      * Identity NFT is present at transaction in script
				  3. Update Identity NFT of Governancescript
				      * Change the script address
					  * Move identity NFT
					  * Enables ugradeability for our script
					  *  Necessary to have ugradeability as their could be bugs in the code
					
          
   * When is a proposal valid?
	   * Proposal needs to have existed for at least 5 days
		 * 51% of total number of GovTokens need to be present in transaction (=vote)
		 * 51% of tokens present need to vote yes
		   * Example:
		   * 10,000 Total Tokens (100% of all Tokens)
		   * 5,100 Tokens need to be present (51% of all Tokens)
		   * 2,550 Tokens need to vote **_Yes_** in order to pass the vote

## SCAT DAO

* SCAT  = Smart Contract Audit Token

* Problems of auditing:
  * As a traditional audtior there is always a conflict of interest
* SCAT DAO would fund audits instead of having the auditee pay for it
  * Want's to make sure that Projects use funds from Project Catalyst treasury accordingly
* Smart Contracts Audit is very expensive:
  * $15,000 per Audit
* SCAT DAO community will vote on which projects are voted on
  * **SCAT DAO is not yet on-chain**
	  * Dev Team has all the voting power
* How can you participate in SCAT DAO?

		  * KYC
			* Tokenomics Analysis
			* Website
			* Etc.
		* Layer 2:
		  * More technical analysis of the product
    
      
* How does the audit process work?
  * Three phases:
	  1. Proposal phase (Tokenholders)
		2. Voting window (Tokenholders)
		3.  Audit (SCAT DAO Team)
	* Audit Team:
	  * New Auditers will be trained to extend the core team
		
* Who can propose which entity should be audited?
