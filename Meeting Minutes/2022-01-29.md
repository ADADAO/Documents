## Development

### Front-End for Governance Scripts

* **Three projects need to be implemented (ours, Rats, SCAT)**


### ADAO NFT Project
* Possibility to create our own NFT project to fund our treasury
* **Ideas:**
  * 3D Coin with background of other artists; could be confusing to see it 
  * Promote decentralization; informative and aethically pleasing
* How should we move forward?

  * After that we can vote on the ideas
* Not a priority 
		
### Website v2

### Governance Script
* MVP is almost done
* R is trying to get everything done by January, 30th

  * We will reach out to RatsDAO to openly communicate about the extended deadline 
    * Members emphasized how importan transparency and clear communication is
* Audit:
  * In the future we could get a company to audit our code

## General
