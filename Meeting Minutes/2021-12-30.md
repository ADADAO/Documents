# Meeting 2021-12-30

* ADAO is looking to develop a “succinct” and concerted message that can be deployed by at least a few team members. 

## Legal note:
*A DAO cannot be an LLC if it has more than 100 members

* ADAO would likely not be considered a protocol DAO. It is closer to a service DAO or a grant DAO. 
* ADAO is being diligent and taking a cautious approach regarding labeling themselves in any particular way just yet.  
* Although this makes it sometimes difficult to explain the overall mission,  it allows the flexibility to introduce new ideas and concepts that can steer the DAO in new directions.


## Discussion about Ergopad
* Ergopad is developing launch tools. ADAO’s work on governance tools can be useful to ergopad and a partnership could be beneficial to both projects. 
* Plans to initiate more dialogue. 

## Visit from HEART Pool
* HEART Pool came on to present a project database tool that is being developed. 
* More info was needed on ADAO and we went through an informal mini-audit.  
* We will get Heart pool more info as we go. 



## Upcoming events and meetings:

* Thursday 7pm UCT (2pm EST): discussion on Business Model Canvas

* December 30, 7:45 PM EST:  Members Tommy, KDev, Chris S, Cinna will discuss ADAO Public relations in the voice channel.  A working group will be forming on this topic
