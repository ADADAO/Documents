# Meeting 2021-12-11

## What is going on in the DAO?

* AleksDjuricic joined, he has a legal background. **Useful**
* We finalized our Project Catalyst Proposal


### News form R:
* Believes that end-points are working correctly
*  Working with the PAB:
  * Gets down to instantiating the script on the PAB
  * Backend of our script website would run on a backend server with an cardano-node
    *  That node would be the way the users would communicate with the blockchain
    *  Front-End would communicate via API with the backend
      *  JSON files would be used
		  
### Comments from Ibis: 
* Lower saturated pools could use assistance
* How to distribute GovTokens to stake pools:
  * Use a halving mechanism when distributing GovTokens
  * Use some sort of Charging period
	  * Would work a bit like conviction voting, the longer you stake the more GovToken you receive
	  * Possibly use DripDropz
* Help pools with marketing or in any other way
  * **Possibility for a SPO DAO**
* Ibis wants to finish the YoctoDAO Overview 
#### What is YoctoDAO?
* Smallest measurement of a DAO / smallest DAO possible
* Base building block 
* Software Stack that can be deployed by various other communities

### Ideas from DzCodes:
* Thinks about forking Snapshot App
  * Downfalls of Snapshot on ETH:
	  * Uses centralized database to record token distribution
		
* DZ thinks he could make the forked Snapshot App more decentralized
  * Implement with NAMI wallet
* Front-End is already included in the open-source repo from Snapshot

		

		
### Discussion about Initial Token Drop:
* We are building ADAO from the ground up
  * ADAO is still able to change as we are fairly small
	* **Meeting minutes are our source of truth**
* We have to research and propose token distribution models we want to use
* Establish dedicated work group that focuses on:
  * Game theory/ Tokenomics
  * What percentages of GovToken should be allocated how?
  * _We don't want to fall back to a centralized organization_
#### **Possible Token distribution layers:**
  1. Discord distribution to initial members - Yes
  2. Delegators of lower saturated pools - Yes
  3. Bounties - Yes (_Could become an issue in regards to Howey test_)
  4.  Founders - No
  5.  Fundraising - No, would make the GovToken a security
				

	
				
### Discussion about legal issues:
*  **How can we make sure that we can mitigate the risks of an initial token distribution?**
  * Formalize distribution model
  *  Incorporate into an LLC
  *  GovToken will not generate income
  *  No IDO
  *  GovToken can only be used to vote
			
* SEC could deem that our Token is a security
  * That could mean that token holders could possibly be held liable by other token holders
	* Possible solution for US citizen:
	  * Form an LLC to protect yourself = _Not ideal_
				
* **Important to note that if we want to incorporate we operate as a non-profit organization**
* **Wyoming DAO law:**
  * DAO is in fact an LLC - Aleks

	

	
## To-Do:
* Research pitfalls of different DAOs
* Develop an advanced on-boarding process:
* Dedicated member that records ADAOs history 
* Formulate Governance Distribution model
  * Write it down
  * Review it
  * Make sure it's properly formatted
* Establish working groups for:
  * **YoctoDAO** - Ibis, Adam, …
  * **Tokenomics** – Sims, Lovecoach, …
  * **Legal issues** – Lovecoach, AleksDjuric, Ibis, Adam, TCT
	  * Look into different countries and how other DAOs pursue it
	  * Which countries have a favorable legislation?
		  * Switzerland(?)

## Ideas: 
* Creation of a legal DAO
  * Works as a fund that protects DAO members if they are sued and need legal assistance
