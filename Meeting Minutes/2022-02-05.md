# Meeting 2022-02-05

## General 
* ADAO approximately has ~20 active contributors
* Hundreds of other contributors in the server
* With introduction of V2 Governance Script a wider range of community participant will be able to actively engage in ADAO governance
* Ibis proposed name change of Media WG to Graphic Design/Branding WG
  * Education WG and Graphic Design WG are closely working together
  * Focus on communication
  * _Right hand needs to know what the left hand is doing_
  * Might be good to implement the role of Creative director that oversees all content being produced by ADAO
* Idea was discussed that every working group should create a weekly progress report that is submited in the Documentes Repo of ADAOs GitHUb
  * Would boost transparency and help members to easily understand the current progress/status of each working group
  * Incentivize members to write progress reports
  * Could be a standing bounty
### Governance Script
* 16 V1 GovTokens
* 100 Mil V2 GovTokens
  * Distribute from treasury
  * Until V2 is released we will have to vote with V1 tokens on how to distribute V2 Tokens from ADAO treasury 
* We will use faucet created by DZ to distribute V2 Tokens
  * DZ mentiuoned that users will have to use their discord account to claim tokens
* Every core contributor that would like to be responsible of voting with the cardano-cli, can request a V1 GovToken from current holders

  
## Development 
* Front-end for our governance script is the biggest bottle neck
* R is working on integration of governance script
* Biggest struggle: Cardano serialization library, manually calculating fees
  * Alessandro Berry wrote a serialization library
  * We currently need to manually create transactions
  * Library doesnt allow you to mint inside a transaction
  * Delays progress
 
* Token is inside the contract
* On-chain code is done
* Talks about creating our own library or contributing to others
 
### Governace Script for RatsDAO 
* Minor issues with front-end integration
* We will do an internal audit off our on-chain code for our governance scripts
* Plan to create documentation for our scripts on how they work
* We are opnely and transparently communicating with RatsDAO
* MVP for RatsDAO will be out in the next couple of days
 
### Front-End for ADAO Governance Script
* Rhys[STOIC] is working on wireframes
* Will have some screens ready in the next days
* Rough estimation on when our voting platform with a nice GUI is out: **2 months**

### ADAO Website
* Blockjock wants to improve ADAOs website and enable donation functionality
* Plan is to include that in V3 of our website
* We currently use WordPress
* R mentioned that we have a donation functionality in our repos
* Important to reach out to Rhys[STOIC] for him to include that in our screens

* It will be possible to request funding from ADAO treasury
* How does a spending proposal:
  * Bounty is proposed
  * Someone that already finished the work or wants to tackle the bounty comes forward
  * After validation rewards are distributed
* Bounty budgets will be mainly distributed to working groups
    * WG will be able to create bounties and distribute funds
* How does this work?
  * Working groups will have their own smart contract based treasury that is controlled by trusted individuals who hold the keys to that treasury
  * Trusted individuals have to be members of the working group
    * 3-7 members per working group

* Working groups have to request funding from ADAO treasury in accordance to the proposal standard
* After vote occurs and proposal is funded the dedicated amount will be allocated to a dedicated script address which the trusted individuals will have access to
* WG will be a defacto DAO
  * Separate Treasury controlled by separate tokens
  * Create their own bounties 
  * Spearate organizational structure
