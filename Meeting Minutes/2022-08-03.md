August 3rd - Wednesday Meeting

Meeting starts off with a bang - The Merch for The Rare Bloom event has been designed and is now ready to order. The products are coming from over seas but should arrive with plenty of time before the event.  Pictures of the merch can be found in the Branding Working Group on Discord. A google docs sheet is available for those who would like to order products. 
	- There is a multi-sig address where funds can be sent for donations and/or mercy purchasing.  More details to follow.
