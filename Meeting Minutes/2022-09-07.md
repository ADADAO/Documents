September 7


Meeting minutes - what to do with them ? Does anyone read them ? 
	- Should we look for new methods to distribute information
			- text  v   video 
	- how much value is there in keeping a community up to speed on whatâ€™s going on? 
	- possible to do a mailer to ADAO members via something like Mailchimp 

Catalyst : 
	- There is a video detailing catalyst proposals , please check Catalyst channel


ADAO Merchandise :
	- Merchandise is on-time 
	- still need additional funds to complete the total order. As of now we can possibly satisfy merchifying the Rare Bloom event but not the entire group of interested people.   Donations can be sent to ADAO address found in the Branding WG channel 
	

Trivia Night : 
	- look for possible collaboration with the team from PlayerMint as they are hosting a week of Catalyst themed events starting September 12.  On Tuesday, sept 13 they are looking to do a trivia night. 
	- ADAO team member will reach out to coordinate
