  * Dedicated working group 
  * Quasar volunteered to take over the content sharing team

## Community Mangement
* When should we start to on-board new members?
  * Discussion about waiting to really push the server until the initial article is out
* How can new members contribute?
		* Thats what a lot of people newer community members are asking themselves
	
## Ideas:
* Area for new members / Safe space to ask questions
  * Q&A section
* Improving on-boarding process:
  * Terminology is hard / Establish a glossary
* Use DripDropz to distribute Tokens:
  * **Community wide**
	* ~~Potentially using only single pool operators~~
	* ~~Forms for SPOs to fill out to be elligible for Token Drop~~
* Community wide distribution would be a good marketing gig
  *  What are the costs of doing that?
	* Timing of drop
* Catalyst Proposal:
  * Voting period from 2022-01-13 to 2022-01-27
	* We want to push our proposal via various Twitter spaces
* Process for publishing content:
  a. Write content
	b. Share it in community
	c. Check brand message
	d. Adapt it
	e. Publish it
* TCT and Allusian work on a way to collect ADA addresses from users for community distribution
  *  DZ offered help with hcreating a discord bot
