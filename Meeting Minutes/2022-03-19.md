#### DEVELOPMENT 

##### Multi-Sig Web UI
- Efforts are now being concentrated on integration work
  - Connection to the ledger and actually submitting/sending transactions
- We are exploring various options on how to connect users with the ledger and eachother
- **Ideally we want to enable users to run their own coordination server, without depending on a 3rd party**

**Which parameters can the users set?**
  1. Specify how many people need to sign a transaction
  2. Wallet address of the various signees
**What will the Multi-sig do?**
  - Create the wallet address with the chosen parameters
  - Enabling users to easily fund the address
  - Create transactions from the treasury_ 
    - Will create a link
    - Share the link between signees to succesfully submit the transaction to the blockchain
  - You will be able to see who already signed the transaction
**How will the development team be compensated?**
-   ~50k-100k  ADAO tokens is the rough budget for the work done on the multi-sig web ui
  - _Further discussion: Determine the exact number of tokens and how they should be distributed_
##### Faucet
- Faucet is available
- Final tests are happening
- Early supporters will have to claim their tokens
  - Faucet will check if the user who tries to claim has the early supporter role in Discord
		
#### COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT

- Tommy and TCT had a meeting with a music collaborative
	- _ADAO is providing insights on how to properly manage a community and possibly transition to a DAO structure_

#### BRANDING AND MEDIA

### DISCUSSION ABOUT DONE-COLLECTIVELY

**What is Done-Collectively (DC)?**
- DAO management tool
- An easy to use UI for DAO members
- DC will display the various layers of a DAO and their specific tasks/membership structure 
  1. Main Organization
	2. Working groups
  3. Sub-working groups
		
**What is the mission of Done-collectively?**
- Become the primary DAO management tool

**What would ADAOs role be in a partnership?**
- ADAO would function as an advisor, collaborate with them; Sign-in with Cardano would be really interesting; 
- ADAO would ideally be a founding part of Done collectively

**Will done collectively enable on-chain governance?**
- Not from the start, but there is intent to do so

**Who is the team behind DC?**
- Founder / Software Engineer / Mastermin: Randall
  - _At the moment DC is a one-man team_
 
**Is DC a registered company?**
- Yes. DC is a colorado LCA
  - _LCA adds for there to be room for investors to be  actively involved in the organizations_
  
**Is DC a DAO?**
- Not from the start
- DC wants to become a DAO:
  - _Transition to a DAO, once the product is released_
- DC wants to take the secure route and not just dump tokens on the market and potentially ruining their product
  
**Will DC be a for-profit organization?**
* Yes. There is commercial intent

**How does DC pland to generate revenue?**
* Initial intuition:  Subscription model
* Discussion was held about other methods of generating revenue:
    - Tribute mechanism when using smart contracts capability from DC
    - Potentially an NFT sale to fund initial development
    - Cardano Stakepool
