Meeting August 24th 

High attendance meeting 

People may be underestimating the potential impact of Summon on the cardano community and beyond 
	- more and more members of the community are noticing and reaching out to lend support 

Catalyst Circle :
	- ADAO would prefer to strengthen its involvement in the circle and the catalyst process in general
	- A video of the latest circle meeting was posted in the meeting chat. 

Proposals:
	- possible mistake on a previous vote 
		- ADAO Jeopardy game by the Education working group has indeed actually passed 
	- Please check out proposals 
	- There is a need to create more visibility for proposals and votes. 

* There is a need for input and even actual proposals on ways and methods to handle proposing and voting.  How many yes votes in relation to no ? Weighted voting ? Voting on proposals different than voting on final decisions ? 
    * There is a google doc related to this where members can add their input and ideas
    * Feel free to create a bounty proposal to award contributors on designing these voting and selection methods

Who else is working on similar issues as ADAO ? 
	- ADAOâ€™s good friends at Liqwid are working on some of the same issues
	- Liqwid has an active discord with active discussion going on regarding governance that ADAO members are welcomed to join and contribute to 

Education Working Group:
	- Will put out some Jeopardy marketing and promotional material in the coming weeks
	- There will be a sample run, sneak peek before it goes live

** This meeting had new members with good ideas and contributions. Always great to have that as it drives conversation and learning **
